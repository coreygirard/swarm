# Swarm

## Hello World

```
define hello:
    init:
        "Hello World!" -> print
```
```
Hello World!
```

## Conceptual structure

The design of **Swarm** is meant to emulate the design paradigm of microservice architecture on a smaller scale (think one server instance rather than many). To that end, the overall structure is analogous to a set of distinct processes that communicate via HTTP-style requests. These pseudo-processes are called 'agents', and the requests are handled via the 'send' command (`->`).

## Design goals

- Handles HTTP requests easily "out of the box"
- Excels as a server talking to many APIs
- Easy multiprocessing and flexible scaling
- Powerful and efficient HTML generation

## Philosophy

- Language design should encourage good program design
- If possible, don't reinvent the wheel. People already know how to use wheels.
- Prioritize legibility. Code is written once. It's read many times, usually by people unfamiliar with it (even your own future self!)
- Be just clever enough
- Less is more

## Language Vision

- A single file can be run locally, deployed to a single cloud server, or auto-deployed to a set of servers, by only changing a few options. (This seems most easily doable by having a deployment manager that reads the code, either asks the user or reads a brief deployment config file, and deploys it in the desired fashion. Presumably transpiling will be required, potentially rewriting one source file into many, for many distinct services, while keeping all the links of flow intact)
- A single file (or several files with imports, if it aids human conceptualization) can describe an entire composite of microservices

## The `send` command

Understanding the 'send' command is critical for effective programming in Swarm. **Agents** don't communicate through traditional function calls, such as the following (Python):

```
def doubleIt(n):
    return n*2

def tripleIt(n):
    return n*3

def f(n):
    return tripleIt(doubleIt(n))

print(f(1))
```
Here, `f` is called, and execution of everything else stops. Then `f` calls `doubleIt`, and `f` stops to wait for the results returned by `doubleIt`. Once `f` resumes, it then calls `tripleIt` again, and again waits for results. Finally, it returns the result back to the `print` function. **Swarm** handles this rather differently:

```
define main:
    init:
        1 -> doubleIt
        
define doubleIt(n):
        n*2 -> tripleIt
        
define tripleIt(n):
        n*3 -> print
```
The send command (`->`) sends the data on its left to the **agent** on its right. Mechanically, this can be modelled as the following: **agents** have a data queue, and they repeatedly pop items from the front of the queue and execute themselves on that data, for as long as there is data in the queue. The send command appends a piece of data to the back of that queue. This way, it is possible for these components to communicate in a non-blocking fashion.



## Agents

Basic program structure is defining a set of **agents**:

```
define average:
    init:
        total,n = 0,0

    run(e):
        total,n = total+e,n+1
        total/n -> print
```

**Agents** have two specially named parts:

- `init` is executed once initially
- `run` is executed repeatedly, every time data is sent to the function/agent

```
define total:
    init:
        t = 0

    run(e):
        t = t + e
        t -> print
```        

```
define fibonacci:
   init:
       (0,0) -> fibonacci
   
   run(a,b):
       a -> print
       (b,a+b) -> fibonacci
```

Any number of other inputs can be defined, sent to via the `.` command, for example `agent.input`. Sending data to the function name itself, ie `-> agent` is equivalent to sending to the `.run` subagent, ie `-> agent.run`

```

define example:
    init:
        # do stuff
        
    run(n):
        n + ' received by example.run' -> print
        
    a(n):
        n + ' received by example.a' -> print

    b(n):
        n + ' received by example.b' -> print

define test:
    init:
        5 -> example
        4 -> example.run
        3 -> example.a
        2 -> example.b
```

```
5 received by example.run
4 received by example.run
3 received by example.a
2 received by example.b
```

Both `init` and `run` are optional. The following is completely valid:

```
define example:
    alternateInput(n):
        # do things
```

In the above example, the command `42 -> example` would be invalid (because `example.run` hasn't been defined), but `42 -> example.alternateInput` would work.


When `run` is the only section defined, it can be abridged. The following two definitions are equivalent:
```
define example:
    run(n):
        n -> other
```
```
define example(n):
        n -> other
```

You can imagine each **agent** as a process, and each **subagent** as a thread within that process. the `init` command, when used within an **agent**'s definition, will initialize variables that are shared among all **subagents**

## Structures

**Structures** are defined inside the `init` section of an agent:

```

define shift:
    init:
        type point(x,y)
        delta = point(0,0)

    run(p):
        p = point(p)
        point(p.x+delta.x,p.y+delta.y) -> nextThing
    
    changeShift(p):
        delta.x,delta.y = p.x,p.y

```

## Built-in Agents

Certain agent names, such as `print`, `error`, `logging`, and `analytics`, are already assigned to internal functionality, and are therefore invalid for user-defined agents. They can, and should, be *sent* to, however:

### error
```
define example:
    init:
        'This is an example error' -> error
```
```
ERROR in 'example': This is an example error
```

### print
```
'Strings work' -> print
5 -> print
'Integers work',5 -> print

' ' -> print.separator
for i in [0:5):
    i -> print

'\n' -> print

', ' -> print.separator
for i in [0:5):
    i -> print
0, 1, 2, 3, 4,

        
```
```
Strings work
5
'Integers work',5
0 1 2 3 4
0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
```

### logging (to file)
```
define example:
    init:
        'Something happened' -> logging
        'Something else happened' -> logging
        wait(3)
        'And another thing -> logging
```
```
# excerpt of logging text file
1510933165: [2017-11-17 3:39:25 PM GMT] [example.init] Something happened
1510933165: [2017-11-17 3:39:25 PM GMT] [example.init] Something else happened
1510933168: [2017-11-17 3:39:28 PM GMT] [example.init] And another thing
```

### logging (to screen)
```
define example:
    init:
        true -> logging.toScreen
        false -> logging.toFile
        'Something happened' -> logging
        'Something else happened' -> logging
        wait(3)
        'And another thing' -> logging
```
```
1510933165: [2017-11-17 3:39:25 PM GMT] [example.init] Something happened
1510933165: [2017-11-17 3:39:25 PM GMT] [example.init] Something else happened
1510933168: [2017-11-17 3:39:28 PM GMT] [example.init] And another thing
```

### analytics

```
define example:
    init:
        'apple' -> analytics
        'pear' -> analytics
        wait(4)
        'apple' -> analytics
        wait(3*60)
        'apple' -> analytics
```
```
# analytics text file
tag: 'apple'
[2017-11-17 3:39:25 - 3:39:30 PM GMT] : 2
[2017-11-17 3:42:25 - 3:42:30 PM GMT] : 1

tag: 'pear'
[2017-11-17 3:39:25 - 3:39:30 PM GMT] : 1
```
(Specification for `analytics` is subject to change)


## User-modified agents

Certain pre-existing agents are meant to be user-defined in order to add certain functionality, such as the `HTTP` agent:

```
define HTTP:
    receive(req):
        req -> server

define server:
    init:
        ip,'Hello' -> HTTP.send
        
    run(req):
        'Received something' -> print
```
`HTTP.send` can be sent to, but cannot be user-defined. `HTTP.receive` should be defined in order to route incoming HTTP traffic to various other agents in the program.

## HTML generation

Swarm is designed to make HTML generation as easy as possible:

```
listItems = ['apple','pear','orange','banana']

html = '''
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title><<<title>>></title>
</head>
<body>
{{{body}}}
</body>
</html>
'''

body = '<ul>'
for i in listItems:
    body += '<li>{item}</li>'.replace('{item}',i)
body += '</ul>'

html.replace((('{{{body}}}',body),
              ('<<<title>>>','Fruit: A Primer')))

html.human
html -> print
```
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Fruit: A Primer</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>apple</li>
      <li>pear</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>banana</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```
Note that no particular syntax is required to denote where to replace, ie `<<<title>>>` and `{{{body}}}` both worked fine. Anything you can specify via regex, you can replace. The replacement happens one pair at a time, over the entire document:
```
s = 'aab'
s.replace((('ab','aab'),
           ('aab','aa')))
s -> print
s = 'aab'
s.replace((('aab','aa'),
           ('ab','aab')))
s -> print
```
```
aaa
aa
```

Let's try a somewhat more complex HTML generation example:

```
define records:
    init:
        status1 = {'Service X':'green',
                   'Service Y':'green',
                   'Service Z':'green'}
        status2 = {'Service I':'green',
                   'Service J':'red',
                   'Service K':'green'}

    run(ip):
        ip,{'Status: Group 1':status1,'Status: Group 2':status2} -> build
    
define build(ip,data):
        template = '''
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>{{{title}}}</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            {{{body}}}
          </body>
        </html>
        '''

        body = ''
        for group,elem in data:
            body += '<h2>{{{group}}}</h2>'.replace('{{{group}}}',group)
            body += '<p><ul>'
            for service,status in elem:
                body += '<li style="color:{{{status}}}">{{{service}}}</li>'.replace((('{{{service}}}',service),
                                                                                     ('{{{status}}}',status)))
            body += '</ul></p>'

        template.replace((('{{{title}}}','STATUS REPORT'),
                          ('{{{body}}}',body)))
        
        template.human
        template -> HTTP.send(ip)
```


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>STATUS REPORT</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Status: Group 1</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li style="color:green">Service X</li>
        <li style="color:green">Service Y</li>
        <li style="color:green">Service Z</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Status: Group 2</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li style="color:green">Service I</li>
        <li style="color:red">Service J</li>
        <li style="color:green">Service K</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>

```









Regexes with or without capture groups are also valid arguments to pass to `.replace`. For example, the following will remove all bold tags from a string, while leaving their contents unchanged.
```
someBigString.replace(((r'<b>(.*?)</b>',r'\1')))
```
This command will bold all instances of 'Swarm' or 'swarm', and italic all instances of 'Agent', 'Agents', 'agent', or 'agents':
```
someBigString.replace(((r'([Ss]warm)',r'<b>\1</b>'),
                       (r'([Aa]gent[s]?)',r'<i>\1</i>')))
```
