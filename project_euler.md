### Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```
define driver:
    init:
        for n in range(1000):
            n -> filter5
        -1 -> filter5

define filter5(n):
        if n%5 == 0 or n == -1:
            n -> filter3

define filter3(n):
        if n%3 == 0 or n == -1:
            n -> sum

define sum:
    init:
        total = 0
        
    run(n):
        if n == -1:
            total -> print
        else:
            total += n
```



### Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```

define fib:
    init:
        (1,2) -> fib
        
    run(a,b):
        if a <= 4000000:
            a -> even
            (b,a+b) -> fib
        else:
            -1 -> even

define even(n):
        if n%2 == 0 or n == -1:
            n -> sum

define sum:
    init:
        total = 0
        
    run(n):
        if n == -1:
            total -> print
        else:
            total += n

```

### Problem 3

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

```

define initiate:
    init:
        ceil(sqrt(600851475143)) -> candidates

define candidates:
    init:
        found = false

    run(top):
        while top > 0 and not found:
            top -> filterPrime
            top -= 1

    setFound(_):
        found = true

define isPrime(n):
        if n > 2:
            prime = true
            for i in range(2,n):
                if not n%i:
                    prime = false
                    break
            if prime:
                -> candidates.setFound
                n -> print

```


### Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

```


### Problem 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

```
